<h1>GradeWiz Privacy Policy</h1>
<p>Last Updated: 12th June 2024</p>

<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>In 2024, GradeWiz launched as an AI-powered academic grading solution. As we continue to improve and support the
    GradeWiz product, we also strive to maintain the highest standards of privacy and security. This Privacy Policy
    describes how GradeWiz collects, uses, shares, and secures the personal data you provide. It also describes your
    choices regarding use, access, and changes to your personal data. If you have any questions or concerns, please
    reach out to us at <a href="mailto:legal@gradewiz.ai">legal@gradewiz.ai</a>.</p>

<h2>Privacy Pledge</h2>
<p>Integrity is at the heart of all we do; it defines us. Protecting your personal data is our top priority. We are
    fully committed to transparency and using technology responsibly. We strive to adhere to the strictest privacy
    practices so that your trust is well-deserved, and because your peace of mind is important to us, we guard your
    personal data with the utmost care. We use it only for lawful reasons.</p>

<h2>Data We Collect</h2>
<p>When you create an account with us, or when a student has their work processed by GradeWiz, we process personal
    data
    (such as name, email address, job title, and school) so that we can correctly administer your account and
    provide
    you with the best customer service. The types of information we request and collect are connected to specific
    purposes, such as:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Verifying your identity and connection with a specific institution or company to determine your eligibility
        to
        use our services.
    </li>
    <li>Providing receipt and confirmation of successful data uploads.</li>
    <li>Sending important messages about our service, such as any changes to functionality.</li>
    <li>Providing additional product and service support as needed.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Why We Collect Personal Data</h2>
<p>All personal data we process is directly linked to a specific purpose. For instance, requesting access to our
    academic content database, sending grading data to your LMS, or requesting web content (e.g., a newsletter, case
    study, video). At any time, you can access, update, rectify, or erase any personal data by logging into your
    account
    and clicking “User Info” or contacting Customer Support.</p>

<h2>Protecting Your Data</h2>
<p>We endeavor to keep your personal data safe and secure at all times. Personal data is processed within the United
    States. We have robust technical and organizational safeguards in place to protect such personal data,
    including:</p>
<ul>
    <li>SSL encryption.</li>
    <li>Redundant servers and data centers.</li>
    <li>Sophisticated perimeter security.</li>
</ul>
<p>Even with the best security systems, it is impossible to guarantee 100% protection from hackers and unauthorized
    third parties who capture information provided over public networks.</p>

<h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
<p>We use Google Cloud, Vercel, and OpenAI's services to assist in grading student work. We focus on the fact that
    we
    only share the work itself completely anonymized, with no way of inferring who is the author. To our knowledge,
    OpenAI does not use this work to train AI models. Any third-party company providing a related service must meet
    our
    security standards and those of the applicable legislation.</p>

<h2>Data Retention</h2>
<p>We retain student data for as long as they have an account with us. Users can request deletion of their data by
    emailing <a href="mailto:legal@gradewiz.ai">legal@gradewiz.ai</a>.</p>

<h2>Cookies and Tracking Technologies</h2>
<p>GradeWiz and its partners may use cookies or similar technologies to analyze trends, administer the site, track
    users' movements around the site, and gather demographic information about our user base as a whole. It does not
    use
    cookies for profiling. You can control whether or not cookies are allowed through your browser. If you choose to
    disable cookies, it may limit the use of certain features or functions of our websites or services.</p>

<h2>Social Media Features & Widgets</h2>
<p>Our Site includes social media features, such as the Facebook “Like” button, the “Share This” widget, or
    interactive
    mini-programs that run on our site. These features may collect your IP address, record which pages you visit on
    our
    site, and set a cookie to enable the feature to function properly. These features and widgets are sometimes
    hosted
    by a third party. Your interactions with these features are governed by the Privacy Pledge of the company
    providing
    the specific feature.</p>

<h2>Blog</h2>
<p>Our Site offers publicly accessible blogs. You should be aware that any information you provide in these areas
    may be
    read, collected, and used by others who access them. To request removal of your personal data from our blog or
    community forum, email us at <a href="mailto:legal@gradewiz.ai">legal@gradewiz.ai</a>. In some cases, we
    may
    not be able to remove your personal data, in which case we will let you know if we are unable to do so and why.
    You
    may also post a comment on our blog with the use of a third-party application that may require you to register
    to
    post a comment. We do not have access or control of the information posted to the blog. You will need to contact
    or
    login into the third-party application if you want the personal data that was posted to the comments section
    removed. To learn how the third-party application uses your information, please review their privacy policies.
</p>

<h2>Compliance</h2>
<p>GradeWiz serves a global community of educators and students, whose views on data privacy may differ
    significantly.
    Our products and services, as well as our privacy policies, are regularly audited and inspected by both
    employees
    and external consultants to ensure that we meet, and exceed where possible, privacy expectations and
    requirements.
    GradeWiz conducts periodic compliance reviews to verify that this Privacy Policy is accurate, comprehensive,
    prominently displayed, lawful, complete, implemented, and accessible. Any employee who violates this Privacy
    Policy
    will be subjected to disciplinary action.</p>

<h2>GDPR Compliance</h2>
<p>This section applies where the GDPR applies to GradeWiz’s processing of the personal data of data subjects in the
    EU.

    and
    italicized terms correspond to the definitions in the GDPR. This section is binding on GradeWiz.</p>
<p>GradeWiz confirms that it:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Processes the personal data only on documented instructions from the controller, including with regard to
        transfers of personal data to a third country or an international organization, unless required to do so by
        Union or Member State law to which the processor is subject; in such a case, the processor shall inform the
        controller of that legal requirement before processing, unless that law prohibits such information on
        important
        grounds of public interest.
    </li>
    <li>Ensures that persons authorized to process the personal data have committed themselves to confidentiality or
        are
        under an appropriate statutory obligation of confidentiality.
    </li>
    <li>Takes all measures required pursuant to Article 32.</li>
    <li>Respects the conditions referred to in paragraphs 2 and 4 of Article 28 for engaging another processor and
        shall, in the event that it engages another processor in the delivery of the service, ensure that the
        processor
        adheres to the same data protection obligations in accordance with paragraph 3 of Article 28.
    </li>
    <li>Taking into account the nature of the processing, assists the controller by appropriate technical and
        organizational measures, insofar as this is possible, for the fulfillment of the controller’s obligation to
        respond to requests for exercising the data subject’s rights laid down in Chapter III.
    </li>
    <li>Assists the controller in ensuring compliance with the obligations pursuant to Articles 32 to 36 taking into
        account the nature of processing and the information available to the processor.
    </li>
    <li>At the request of the controller, deletes or returns all the personal data to the controller after the end
        of
        the provision of services relating to processing, and deletes existing copies unless Union or Member State
        law
        requires storage of the personal data.
    </li>
    <li>Makes available to the controller all information necessary to demonstrate compliance with the obligations
        laid
        down in Article 28 and allow for and contribute to audits, including inspections, conducted by the
        controller or
        another auditor mandated by the controller.
    </li>
</ul>

<h2>General</h2>

<p>The parties agree that any and all disputes, claims, or controversies arising out of or relating to these terms

    conditions that are not resolved by mutual agreement shall be submitted to final and binding arbitration,
    pursuant
    to the United States Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C. Sec. 1 et seq. The arbitration shall take place in Alameda
    County,
    California, unless the parties otherwise agree in writing. Within fourteen (14) days thereafter, the arbitrator
    shall arrive at a final decision, which shall be reduced to writing, signed by the arbitrator, and mailed to
    each of
    the parties and their legal counsel. All decisions of the arbitrator shall be final, binding and conclusive on
    the
    parties and shall constitute the only method of resolving disputes or matters subject to arbitration pursuant to

    other
    equitable remedies in a court of competent jurisdiction. The arbitrator or a court of appropriate jurisdiction
    may
    issue a writ of execution to enforce the arbitrator’s judgment. Judgment may be entered upon such a decision in
