<h1>Terms of Use</h1>
<p>Welcome to GradeWiz.tech, a website and online service of GradeWiz Corporation (“GradeWiz,” “we,” or “us”). This
    page
    explains the terms by which you may use the GradeWiz online and/or mobile services, web site, and software
    provided
    on or in connection with all of GradeWiz’s services (the “Service”).</p>
<p>By accessing or using the Service, you signify that you have read, understood, and agree to be bound by these
    Terms
    of Service (the “Terms”) and to the collection and use of your information as set forth in the GradeWiz Privacy
    Policy whether or not you are a registered user of our Service. If you do not agree, you may not use the
    Service.
    GradeWiz reserves the right to make unilateral modifications to these terms and will provide notice of these
    changes
    as described below. These Terms apply to all visitors, users, and others who access the Service (“Users”).</p>
<p>In the event that GradeWiz and any School (as defined below) have entered into a separate agreement for the
    Services,
    such agreement shall govern to the extent that any terms directly conflict with the provisions of these Terms.
</p>
<p>We have provided headings and summaries in each section for your convenience; however, the summaries are not
    meant to
    limit the Terms and shall not affect or limit in any way the meaning or interpretation of the Terms.</p>

<h2>1. Use of Our Service</h2>
<h3>Summary: In order to use the Service, you need to be able to form a binding contract and create an account. You
    are
    responsible for and warrant authority over all of your user activity. Your use cannot disrupt or interfere with
    the
    Service.</h3>

<h4>Eligibility</h4>
<p>You may use the Service only if you can form a binding contract with GradeWiz, and only in compliance with these
    Terms and all applicable local, state, national, and international laws, rules, and regulations.</p>

<h4>GradeWiz Service</h4>
<p>Subject to the terms and conditions of these Terms, you are hereby granted a non-exclusive, limited,
    non-transferable, freely revocable license to use the Service for your personal, noncommercial use only and as
    permitted by the features of the Service. GradeWiz reserves all rights not expressly granted herein in the

    no
    reason.</p>

<h4>GradeWiz Accounts</h4>

    time
    to time and in our sole discretion. We may maintain different types of accounts for different types of Users.
</p>
<p>You may never use another User’s account without permission. When creating your account, you must provide
    accurate
    and complete information, and you must keep this information up to date. You are solely responsible for the
    activity
    that occurs on your account, and you must keep your account password secure. We encourage you to use “strong”
    passwords (passwords that use a combination of upper and lower case letters, numbers, and symbols) with your
    account, and enforce a minimum length. You must notify GradeWiz immediately of any breach of security or
    unauthorized use of your account by emailing support@gradewiz.ai. GradeWiz will not be liable for any losses
    caused by any unauthorized use of your account.</p>

<h4>Teachers</h4>
<p>If you are using your account as a teacher, professor, or other similar instructor (a “Teacher”) and use the
    Service
    to add or invite any students (“Students”) to access and use the Service, you represent and warrant that you
    have
    the authority to act on behalf of your school, university, or other institution (the “School”) and that use of
    the
    Service, including without limitation adding or inviting students to access and use the Service and your use and
    access of the Service in no way violates any agreement between you and the School.</p>

<h4>Schools</h4>
<p>If you are a School and use the Service to add or invite any Students to access and use the Service, to access
    Educational Records, or in any other way without limitation, you represent and warrant that you have the
    authority
    to do so. You may control your User profile and how you interact with the Service by changing the settings on
    your
    settings page. By providing GradeWiz your email address you consent to our using the email address to send you
    Service-related notices, including any notices required by law, in lieu of communication by postal mail. We may
    also
    use your email address to send you other messages, such as changes to features of the Service and special
    offers, as
    detailed in our Privacy Policy.</p>

        operators of public search engines revocable permission to use spiders to copy publicly-available materials
        from

</ul>
<p>We may, without prior notice, change the Service; stop providing the Service or features of the Service, to you

    instructor or teacher, you represent and warrant that you have the right to provide any User Content, including
    without limitation any tests or classroom materials that you provide to the Service. To the extent that your
    User
    Content contains music, you hereby represent that you are the owner of all the copyright rights, including
    without
    limitation the performance, mechanical, and sound recordings rights, with respect to each and every musical
    composition (including lyrics) and sound recording contained in such User Content and have the power to grant
    the
    license granted below. You understand that publishing your User Content on the Service is not a substitute for
    registering it with the U.S. Copyright Office, the Writer’s Guild of America, or any other rights organization.

    work
    rights, moral rights, rights of publicity, trademark, trade dress and service mark rights, goodwill, trade

        has released you from any liability that may arise in relation to such use.
    </li>
    <li>You have obtained and are solely responsible for obtaining all consents as may be required by law to post
        any
        User Content relating to third parties.
    </li>
    <li>Your User Content and GradeWiz’s use thereof as contemplated by these Terms and the Service will not violate
        any
        law or infringe any rights of any third party, including but not limited to any Intellectual Property Rights
        and
        privacy rights.
    </li>
    <li>GradeWiz may exercise the rights to your User Content granted under these Terms without liability for
        payment of
        any guild fees, residuals, payments, fees, or royalties payable under any collective bargaining agreement or
        otherwise.
    </li>
    <li>To the best of your knowledge, all your User Content and other information that you provide to us is
        truthful
        and accurate.
    </li>
</ul>

    third
    party posts, sends, or otherwise makes available over the Service. You shall be solely responsible for your User
    Content and the consequences of posting, publishing it, sharing it, or otherwise making it available on the
    Service,
    and you agree that we are only acting as a passive conduit for your online distribution and publication of your
    User
    Content. You understand and agree that you may be exposed to User Content that is inaccurate, objectionable,
    inappropriate for children, or otherwise unsuited to your purpose, and you agree that GradeWiz shall not be
    liable
    for any damages you allege to incur as a result of or relating to any User Content.</p>

<h4>Student Data</h4>
<p>If you are a Teacher or School that will be providing GradeWiz access to Student Data (as defined below) via the
    GradeWiz service, you authorize GradeWiz to access your student information systems (“SIS”) or receive Student
    Data
    or other information via SIS, Secure File Transfer Protocol (“SFTP”), or other secure transfer method for the
    purpose of providing the Service. “Student Data” is any information (in any format) that is directly related to
    an
    identifiable current or former student that is maintained by a school, school district, or related entity or
    organization, or by us. Student Data may include “educational records” as defined in the Family Educational
    Rights
    and Privacy Act (“FERPA”), 20 U.S.C. § 1232(g).</p>

<h4>Confidentiality</h4>
<p>GradeWiz agrees to treat Student Data as confidential and not to share it with third parties other than as
    described
    in these Terms, including the GradeWiz Privacy Policy, available at <a
            href="https://www.gradewiz.ai/marketing/privacy.html">https://www.gradewiz.ai/marketing/privacy.html</a>.
</p>

<h4>GradeWiz Access</h4>
<p>You authorize GradeWiz to access and process Student Data solely for the purposes of providing the Service, as an
    outsourced institutional function pursuant to FERPA 34 CFR Part 99.31(a)(1). As between GradeWiz and School or
    Teacher, School or Teacher owns right, title, and interest to all Student Data you provide or otherwise make
    available to us, and GradeWiz does not own, control, or license such Student Data, except so as to provide the
    Service described herein. You acknowledge and agree that, as between the parties, you are solely responsible for
    any
    and all Student Data, whether provided by Teacher, School, Student or any other third party.</p>

<h4>Third-Party Access</h4>
<p>By submitting Student Data to GradeWiz, you consent to allow GradeWiz to provide access to Student Data to its
    employees and to certain third-party service providers which have a legitimate need to access such information
    in
    connection with their responsibilities in providing the Service. GradeWiz and its employees, subcontractors,
    service
    providers, or agents involved in the handling, transmittal, and processing of Student Data will be required to
    maintain the confidentiality of such data that includes personally identifiable information and shall not
    redisclose
    such data except as necessary in order to provide the Service or pursuant to the consent and direction of School
    or
    a Student over age 18. GradeWiz will maintain access log(s) that record all disclosures of or access to Student
    Data
    within its possession, and will provide copies of an access log(s) to you upon request.</p>

<h4>Use of Student Data</h4>
<p>By submitting Student Data or other information to the GradeWiz service, you expressly grant, and you represent
    and
    warrant that you have all rights necessary to grant, to GradeWiz a non-exclusive, royalty-free, worldwide
    license
    during the term of these Terms to use, transmit, distribute, modify, reproduce, display, create derivative works
    of,
    and store the Student Data solely for the purposes of (i) providing the Services as contemplated in these Terms,
    and
    (ii) enforcing its rights under these Terms.</p>

<h4>Children’s Data Privacy</h4>
<p>GradeWiz relies on each school to obtain and provide appropriate consent and disclosures, if necessary, to allow
    students to access the GradeWiz service.</p>
<p>You represent and warrant that you have the authority to provide Student Data to GradeWiz, and that you have
    provided
    appropriate disclosures to students and parents regarding your sharing of Student Data with service providers
    such
    as GradeWiz, if needed. We recommend that you provide a copy of our Privacy Policy to parents and guardians.</p>

<h4>Anonymized Data</h4>
<p>You agree that GradeWiz may collect, analyze, and use data derived from Student Data, including de-identified,
    aggregated or anonymized Student Data, as well as data about your, and other users’ access and use of the
    Service,
    for purposes of operating, analyzing, improving, or marketing the Service and for the purpose of providing
    analytic
    services to the School or to other Schools. If GradeWiz shares or publicly discloses information (e.g., in
    marketing
    materials, in application development, or with third parties) that is derived from Student Data, such data will
    be
    de-identified to reasonably avoid identification of a specific school or individual. You further agree that
    GradeWiz
    will have the right, both during and after the Term of these Terms, to use, store, transmit, distribute, modify,
    copy, display, sublicense, and create derivative works of the de-identified, aggregated or anonymized data
    solely
    for the purposes of improving GradeWiz services.</p>

<h4>Deletion Requests</h4>
<p>You may request that GradeWiz delete Student Data in GradeWiz’s possession at any time by providing such a
    request in
    writing, which request GradeWiz shall then comply with in a commercially reasonable time. GradeWiz is not
    required
    to delete data derived from Student Data, including de-identified, aggregated, or anonymized Student Data.</p>

<h4>Change of Control</h4>
<p>By submitting Student Data to the GradeWiz service, you consent to allow GradeWiz to transfer Student Data to a
    new
    provider in the event that GradeWiz sells, divests or transfers the business or a portion of the business,
    provided
    that the new provider has agreed to data privacy standards no less stringent than those set forth in these
    Terms. We
    may also transfer personal information – under the same conditions – in the course of mergers, acquisitions,
    bankruptcies, dissolutions, reorganizations, liquidations, similar transactions or proceedings involving all or
    a
    portion of our business.</p>

<h2>7. Security</h2>
<h3>Summary: We know privacy and security are paramount. We follow industry standards to ensure the security of your
    personal information.</h3>
<p>GradeWiz uses commercially reasonable and appropriate physical, managerial, and technical safeguards to preserve
    the
    integrity and security of your personal information and implement your privacy settings. However, we cannot
    guarantee that unauthorized third parties will never be able to defeat our security measures or use your
    personal
    information for improper purposes. You acknowledge that you provide your personal information at your own risk.
</p>

<h2>8. Paid Services</h2>

    We
    will let you know if our prices change.</h3>

<h4>Billing Policies</h4>

    charges of other Users (such as Teachers). If you elect to use paid aspects of the Service, you agree to the
    pricing
    and payment terms, as we may update them from time to time. You also agree to be bound by the specific terms
    included in any order form, statement of work, or the like (if applicable) to which you indicate your acceptance
    (for instance, by signing the document, via online click-through acceptance, or by making related payments to
    GradeWiz). GradeWiz may add new services to the GradeWiz service for additional fees and charges, or amend fees
    and

    shall
    become effective in the billing cycle following notice of such change to you as provided in this Agreement.</p>

<h4>Payment Information; Taxes</h4>
<p>All information that you provide in connection with a purchase or transaction or other monetary transaction
    interaction with the Service must be accurate, complete, and current. You agree to pay all charges incurred by
    users
    of your credit card, debit card, or other payment method used in connection with a purchase or transaction or
    other
    monetary transaction interaction with the Service at the prices in effect when such charges are incurred. You

<h2>9. Mobile Software</h2>
<h3>Summary: Our Services may be offered via mobile apps, for which we’ll need to give you a license. You can’t do

    the app from Apple).</h3>

<h4>Mobile Software</h4>
<p>We may make available software to access the Service via a mobile device (“Mobile Software”). To use the Mobile
    Software, you must have a mobile device that is compatible with the Mobile Software. GradeWiz does not warrant
    that
    the Mobile Software will be compatible with your mobile device. You may use mobile data in connection with the
    Mobile Software and may incur additional charges from your wireless provider for these services. You agree that
    you
    are solely responsible for any such charges. GradeWiz hereby grants you a non-exclusive, non-transferable,
    revocable
    license to use a compiled code copy of the Mobile Software for one GradeWiz account on one mobile device owned
    or
    leased solely by you, for your personal use. You may not:</p>
<ul>

<h2>15. Governing Law, Arbitration, and Class Action/Jury Trial Waiver</h2>
<h3>Summary: We are based in New York, and any disputes will be arbitrated here. All claims must be brought in the
    party’s individual capacity.</h3>

<h4>Governing Law</h4>
<p>This Agreement will be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of New York, without
    regard
    to its conflict of laws principles. Each party hereby expressly and irrevocably consents to the exclusive
    jurisdiction of the state and federal courts located in New York, NY in connection with any action to enforce
    the
    provisions of this Agreement, to recover damages or other relief under this Agreement, or otherwise arising
    under or
    by reason of this Agreement.</p>

<h4>Arbitration</h4>
<p><strong>READ THIS SECTION CAREFULLY BECAUSE IT REQUIRES THE PARTIES TO ARBITRATE THEIR DISPUTES AND LIMITS THE
    MANNER
    IN WHICH YOU CAN SEEK RELIEF FROM GRADEWIZ.</strong> For any dispute with GradeWiz, you agree to first
    contact us at
    legal@gradewiz.ai and attempt to resolve the dispute with us informally. In the unlikely event that GradeWiz
    has
    not been able to resolve a dispute it has with you after sixty (60) days, we each agree to resolve any claim,
    dispute, or controversy (excluding any claims for injunctive or other equitable relief as provided below)
    arising
    out of or in connection with or relating to these Terms, or the breach or alleged breach thereof (collectively,
    “Claims”), by binding arbitration by JAMS, under the Optional Expedited Arbitration Procedures then in effect
    for
    JAMS, except as provided herein. JAMS may be contacted at <a href="http://www.jamsadr.com">www.jamsadr.com</a>.
    The
    arbitration will be conducted in New York, NY, unless you and GradeWiz agree otherwise. If you are using the
    Service
    for commercial purposes, each party will be responsible for paying any JAMS filing, administrative and
    arbitrator
    fees in accordance with JAMS rules, and the award rendered by the arbitrator shall include costs of arbitration,
    reasonable attorneys’ fees and reasonable costs for expert and other witnesses. If you are an individual using
    the
    Service for non-commercial purposes: (i) JAMS may require you to pay a fee for the initiation of your case,
    unless
    you apply for and successfully obtain a fee waiver from JAMS; (ii) the award rendered by the arbitrator may
    include
    your costs of arbitration, your reasonable attorney’s fees, and your reasonable costs for expert and other
    witnesses; and (iii) you may sue in a small claims court of competent jurisdiction without first engaging in
    arbitration, but this does not absolve you of your commitment to engage in the informal dispute resolution
    process.
    Any judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction.
    Nothing
    in this Section shall be deemed as preventing GradeWiz from seeking injunctive or other equitable relief from
    the
    courts as necessary to prevent the actual or threatened infringement, misappropriation, or violation of our data
    security, Intellectual Property Rights or other proprietary rights.</p>

<h4>Class Action/Jury Trial Waiver</h4>
<p><strong>WITH RESPECT TO ALL PERSONS AND ENTITIES, REGARDLESS OF WHETHER THEY HAVE OBTAINED OR USED THE SERVICE
    FOR
    PERSONAL, COMMERCIAL OR OTHER PURPOSES, ALL CLAIMS MUST BE BROUGHT IN THE PARTIES’ INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND
    NOT AS A
    PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS ACTION, COLLECTIVE ACTION, PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL ACTION
    OR OTHER
    REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. THIS WAIVER APPLIES TO CLASS ARBITRATION, AND, UNLESS WE AGREE OTHERWISE, THE
    ARBITRATOR
    MAY NOT CONSOLIDATE MORE THAN ONE PERSON’S CLAIMS. YOU AGREE THAT, BY ENTERING INTO THESE TERMS, YOU AND
    GRADEWIZ
    ARE EACH WAIVING THE RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY OR TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION, COLLECTIVE ACTION,
    PRIVATE
    ATTORNEY GENERAL ACTION, OR OTHER REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING OF ANY KIND.</strong></p>

<h4>Entire Agreement/Severability</h4>
<p>These Terms, together with any amendments and any additional agreements you may enter into with GradeWiz in
    connection with the Service, shall constitute the entire agreement between you and GradeWiz concerning the
    Service.
    If any provision of these Terms is deemed invalid by a court of competent jurisdiction, the invalidity of such
    provision shall not affect the validity of the remaining provisions of these Terms, which shall remain in full
    force
    and effect, except that in the event of unenforceability of the universal Class Action/Jury Trial Waiver, the
    entire
    arbitration agreement shall be unenforceable.</p>

<h4>No Waiver</h4>
<p>No waiver of any term of these Terms shall be deemed a further or continuing waiver of such term or any other
    term,
    and GradeWiz’s failure to assert any right or provision under these Terms shall not constitute a waiver of such
    right or provision.</p>
